The game is split into 3 distinct areas which are each given a unique coordinate. 

The first coordinate shows which sector of the galaxy you are in.

The second coordinate shows which system within the sector.

The third coordinate shows which planet you are at.

All players start with their home planet which is given the coordinates 0.0.0.

In order to travel to a new planet you will need to first create a fleet in your ship yard and add ships to it on your fleet page.

Once your fleet is ready to move the fleet page allows you to add the coordinates so if you wish to move to a new planet you would simply put in the 3 numbers that relate to that planet and hit move e.g. 1.1.1.

You can also use the drop down menu for any planets you own so that you don't have to remember all your planet coordinates.

Once you are ready to move it is a good idea to check the planet you are heading to. If it is a new planet you may want to know what space and abundances the planet has. If you are going to attack another player you will want to know what ships they may have or how many soldiers are on the planet. 

One way to do this is simply to send your ships there and see what happens, this can be a bad idea as you may get a low abundance planet or run into a bigger hostile fleet than you were expecting.  

The best way to avoid this is to build a Communications Satellite (Comms Sat). This uses energy to scan planets with 3 options available.

Using the same coordinate system you are able to use the Resource Scan which will show abundances and space on the planet, Surface Scan which will show what buildings are on the planet along with the amount of workers and soldiers present, and Fleet Scan which will show all ships in orbit or travelling to the planet.

Building the Comms Sat also gives you access to Radar for the system it has been built in. This means that you can see all other fleets travelling to the system or inside it, useful to know if you are under attack. It is advisable to build a Comms Sat in each system you have planets so that you can always see any incoming fleets.
